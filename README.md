# TheNextWave
Deterministic ocean wave prediction from sparse buoy data.  This methodology and codes generate phase-resolved reconstructions of ocean waves over short time-space scales using measurements of wave motion collected by sparse arrays of Surface Wave Instrument Floats w/ Tracking (SWIFTs).
