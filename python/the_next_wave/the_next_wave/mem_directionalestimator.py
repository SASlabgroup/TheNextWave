    % DESCRIPTION:
    %   Function calculates directional distribution of a wave field using the 
    %  Maximum Entropy Method of Lygre & Krogstad (JPO V16 1986). User passes the
    %  directional moments (a1,b1,a2,b2) and energy density (en) to the function.
    %  The directional moments are expected to be in a right hand coordinate 
    %  system (i.e. north, west) with direction being the direction towards.
    %  The returned energy and directional distributions have been converted to
    %  nautical convention with direction being the direction from.
